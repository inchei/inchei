### THIS IS INCHEI CHAN
- I started to code just for fun, trying to do something for [a wiki on Anime](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn).
- I haven't taken part in any semi-professional activities such as NOIP, which my peers into coding always like to talk about, for something beyond my control, though I'd be quite delighted to be acquainted with those peers.
- Languages: `简体中文` `繁體中文` `English`
- Computer skills: `CSS` `JavaScript` `Python`
