### THIS IS ...
üìö I started to code just for fun, trying to do something for [a wiki on Anime](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn). R.I.P MGP.

‚å®Ô∏è I didn't have any chance to take part in any semi-professional activities such as NOIP, which my peers into coding always like to talk about. Also, I didn't choose software as my career out of some reasons. However, I'd be quite delighted to be acquainted with those peers.

ü©∫ I'm majoring in Clinical Medicine which requires few computer skills. Most of the projects here were lauched when I was in middle school, so the code here may look unprofessional and will be updated unfrequently.
