### THIS IS INCHEI CHAN
- I started to code just for fun, trying to do something for [a wiki on Anime](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn). R.I.P MGP.
- I didn't take part in any semi-professional activities such as NOIP, which my peers into coding always like to talk about because of something beyond my control. Also, I didn't choose software as my career out of some reasons. However, I'd be quite delighted to be acquainted with those peers.
- I'm majoring in Clinical Medicine which requires few computer skills. Most of the projects here were lauched when I was in middle school, so the code here may look unprofessional and will be updated unfrequently.
- Computer skills: `CSS` `JavaScript` `Vue` `Python`
