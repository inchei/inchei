### THIS IS INCHEI CHAN
- I started to code just for fun, trying to do something for [a wiki on Anime](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn).
- I didn't take part in any semi-professional activities such as NOIP, which my peers into coding always like to talk about, for something beyond my control, though I'd be quite delighted to be acquainted with those peers.
- I'm majoring in Clinical Medicine which requires few computer skills. Most of the projects here were lauched when I was in middle school, so the code here may look unprofessional and will be updated unfrequently.
- Computer skills: `CSS` `JavaScript` `Python`
